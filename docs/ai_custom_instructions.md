Ah, I see! You're looking to create custom instructions for an AI (like me) so that I can follow specific steps based on a **local file**, in this case, `ai_custom_instructions.md`, for syncing your instructions directly within the AI. You want the AI to **reference that file** on your machine and use it to dynamically adjust instructions based on the content.

Here's how you could structure your **custom instructions for the AI** based on your local file:

### **Custom Instructions for AI Based on Local `ai_custom_instructions.md` File**

**Goal**: Create a set of instructions that tell the AI to **reference the local file** (`ai_custom_instructions.md`) and use it to provide dynamic responses or tasks, such as syncing Git actions, managing branch creation, and updating the repository.

### **Custom AI Instructions Based on Local File:**

---

#### **1. Structure for the AI’s Custom Instructions:**

These are the instructions that you would provide for the AI to follow, based on the contents of `ai_custom_instructions.md`.

---

**File Path:**
`C:/Users/jnguyen/Documents/Work/Projects/appointmentsystem/docs/ai_custom_instructions.md`

---

#### **Custom Instruction Set for AI:**

---

**Instruction 1: Understand the Local Instructions File**
> "Always refer to the file located at `C:/Users/jnguyen/Documents/Work/Projects/appointmentsystem/docs/ai_custom_instructions.md` for the latest updates regarding Git-related actions. Ensure you are using the most recent version of the file when performing any actions related to Git, branch creation, merging, or syncing tasks."

---

**Instruction 2: Sync Instructions Before Acting**
> "Before any Git-related task, verify that the contents of `ai_custom_instructions.md` are up to date. If any task, such as creating a branch or updating the main branch, is required, first confirm that your instructions from this file have been updated and are reflected in the Git process you follow."

---

**Instruction 3: Provide Git Workflow Based on Updated Instructions**
> "When asked to perform Git-related actions, ensure the actions align with the workflow defined in the `ai_custom_instructions.md` file. This includes actions like:
> - Pulling the latest `main` branch.
> - Creating a new feature branch based on the provided prefix (`feature/name`).
> - Merging feature branches into `main` when completed.
> - Always asking if the user wants to update `main` after pushing changes."

---

**Instruction 4: Keep Instructions Dynamic**
> "Ensure that the instructions provided in `ai_custom_instructions.md` are dynamic and can be updated as needed. If the file contents are updated with new tasks or processes, always adapt and follow the newly updated steps."

---

**Instruction 5: Prompt User for Updates**
> "Before finalizing any Git actions, prompt the user if they want to update the `main` branch with the latest changes after each feature branch update."

---

### **Example of How AI Follows These Instructions:**

**Example Interaction 1:**

**User:**
*"I need to create a new feature branch for the appointment system. Can you do that?"*

**AI:**
*"First, let me ensure I have the latest instructions from the file located at `C:/Users/jnguyen/Documents/Work/Projects/appointmentsystem/docs/ai_custom_instructions.md`... Done. Now, I'll create the new branch based on the latest `main`."*

*AI pulls the latest `main` branch and creates a new feature branch based on the prefix provided (e.g., `feature/appointment-system`).*

**AI:**
*"I've created the feature branch `feature/appointment-system` based on the latest `main`. Would you like me to update `main` with any changes now?"*

---

**Example Interaction 2:**

**User:**
*"I've completed work on `feature/login-system`. Can you merge it with the main branch?"*

**AI:**
*"Let me check if the instructions have been updated in `ai_custom_instructions.md`... I see that the process for merging is correct. First, I’ll pull the latest changes for `main`, merge `feature/login-system`, and then push the updates. Should I proceed with updating the `main` branch now?"*

---

### **How to Update the Instructions in the File:**

- Any time you need to change the process or update the steps for the AI to follow, simply update the contents of `ai_custom_instructions.md`.
- The AI will refer to this file for its guidance.

---

### **Summary:**

This approach ensures that:

- The AI is always pulling its instructions from a **centralized document** (`ai_custom_instructions.md`).
- When tasks like branch creation, merging, or syncing are needed, the AI will **check and follow the most up-to-date instructions** from the file.
- It will also prompt you for important decisions, like whether you want to **update the `main` branch** after any changes.

This structure will allow you to consistently sync and update the AI's behavior without having to manually alter its behavior each time you switch machines or update tasks.

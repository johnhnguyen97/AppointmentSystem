# Roadmap: Booking Appointment System

## Objective
Develop a fully functional booking appointment system with user management, a dashboard, client lists, inventory management, an appointment list with a calendar grid system, and settings. The system will utilize GraphQL for queries and mutations.

## Phase 1: Planning & Requirements Gathering
- Define user roles (e.g., Admin, Staff, Clients).
- Identify core features and UI/UX requirements.
- Design the database schema to support bookings, users, inventory, and settings.
- Select the tech stack for the frontend and backend.

## Phase 2: Backend Development with GraphQL
- Set up the GraphQL API with authentication and authorization.
- Implement the following GraphQL mutations and queries:
  - **User Management:** Register, login, update profiles, role-based permissions.
  - **Clients:** Add, edit, delete clients, view client history.
  - **Inventory:** Manage stock levels, add/edit inventory items.
  - **Appointments:** Create, update, cancel, and retrieve appointments.
  - **Calendar System:** Fetch appointments by date, user, or client.
  - **Settings:** Configure system preferences, notifications, and permissions.
- Implement database relations and data validation.

## Phase 3: Frontend Development
- Develop a **Dashboard** with key metrics and insights.
- Implement **Clients List** with search, filtering, and management.
- Create an **Inventory List** for stock tracking.
- Build an **Appointment List** with a calendar grid system for scheduling.
- Develop a **Settings Page** for system configurations.

## Phase 4: Integration & Optimization
- Connect the frontend with the GraphQL backend.
- Implement real-time updates where necessary.
- Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
- Optimize queries and mutations for performance.
- Improve security measures (e.g., authentication, rate-limiting).

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
- Conduct unit and integration testing for GraphQL APIs.
- Perform UI/UX testing to refine the user experience.
- Fix bugs and improve performance based on feedback.
- Deploy the system to a cloud provider (e.g., Vercel, AWS, or Render).

## Phase 6: Future Enhancements
- Implement notifications for upcoming appointments.
- Add payment processing for bookings.
- Expand reporting and analytics.
- Enable multi-language support.

## Next Steps
- Finalize designs and begin backend development.
- Set up the GraphQL schema and implement the initial API endpoints.
- Begin frontend development with a focus on the dashboard and appointment scheduling.

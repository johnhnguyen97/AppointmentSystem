# Appointment System Test Coverage

## Overview
This test suite covers the core functionality of the appointment system, focusing on client creation, appointment management, and various validation scenarios.

## Test Files

### test_client_appointments.py
Covers core functionality including:
- Client creation and validation
- Appointment scheduling and validation
- Service type handling
- Multi-attendee appointment support
- Status transitions
- Client note management

## Current Test Coverage

âœ… Implemented Tests:
- Client creation with valid user
- Client creation with invalid user (foreign key constraints)
- Basic appointment creation
- Appointment time validation (no past dates)
- Appointment duration validation (15min - 8hrs)
- Unique client-user constraint
- Service type validation
- Multiple attendee handling
- Appointment status transitions
- Client note updates
- Service type changes

## Pending Implementations

### Appointment Scheduling
- [ ] Implement overlap checking in appointment validation
  - Need to add logic to prevent double-booking
  - Should check both creator and attendee availability

### Status Transitions
- [ ] Add validation for appointment status transitions
  - Prevent invalid transitions (e.g., CANCELLED to COMPLETED)
  - Define allowable state machine transitions

### Service History
- [ ] Implement service history tracking for clients
  - Track all services received by client
  - Include timestamps and providers
  - Allow for service type changes while maintaining history

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest src/test/

# Run specific test file
pytest src/test/test_client_appointments.py

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=src/main src/test/
```

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Use descriptive test names that indicate what is being tested
2. Include docstrings explaining test purpose
3. Follow the existing fixture patterns
4. Group related tests together
5. Include both positive and negative test cases
6. Verify all assertions carefully

## Best Practices for Tests

- Each test should focus on one specific feature or validation
- Use fixtures to set up common test data
- Clean up any test data after tests complete
- Test both valid and invalid scenarios
- Include appropriate error messages in assertions
- Keep tests independent and isolated

## Future Enhancements

1. Appointment Conflicts
- Add comprehensive conflict checking
- Support for recurring appointments
- Handle timezone differences

2. Client Management
- Add client preference tracking
- Support for client categories
- Client loyalty/visit tracking

3. Authorization
- Role-based access control tests
- Permission validation
- Admin override scenarios

4. Service Management
- Service duration templates
- Service package tracking
- Provider specialization tests
